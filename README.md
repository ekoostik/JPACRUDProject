# JPACRUDProject

## Description

This web application allows a user to track their flying history. The user is able to see all flights made, log new flights, and make changes to existing flights. This C.R.U.D. full stack application was built from scratch utilizing a database created with MYSQL Workbench.

## Technologies Used

Java, MySQL Workbench, Gradle, Spring Tool Suite, JSP, JDBC.

## Lessons Learned

The repetition of creating Spring Boot Projects from scratch is helping me understand the flow of information. Starting with the JPA Entity on through to the boot project controller and finally to the jsp/html. I feel more comfortable with annotations, dependency injection, request mapping, and the other automated functions of STS/Gradle/Spring. I feel more confident writing the Junit test after this week as well. The introduction to MySQL Workbench was exciting and the process went smoothly. 
I struggled with the front end styling aspect of the project. I need further review of Bootstrap and other HTML styling functions.
